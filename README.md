# simple-weather-scraper
This is a simple weather scraper 

This project was built in my earlier days of coding

Known issues:
I should have created different files for the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP

I can only get to it when i get to it, I am incentivised to create new projects and show the evolution of my coding abilities rather than correcting the "issues"
